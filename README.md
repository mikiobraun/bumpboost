# bumpboost

Reimplementing an algorithm I worked on years ago. It learns a kernel function and is very quick.

Never has been published, but Maximilian Alber did his Master thesis on it and added a [copy of the paper](https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ki/rojas_home/documents/Betreute_Arbeiten/Master-Alber.pdf).
